# Collaboration Demo Project

This repository is a small open-source style project created to practice professional Git and GitHub collaboration workflows.

The focus of this project is not the application itself, but the process used to manage changes in a team environment.

## Project Goals

- Practice working with GitHub Issues, branches, and Pull Requests
- Simulate code reviews and requested changes
- Resolve merge conflicts and use rebase correctly
- Run a simple Continuous Integration (CI) workflow using GitHub Actions
